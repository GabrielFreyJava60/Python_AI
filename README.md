# HW #27 Definition

## Write all methods with TODO comments of the class LfuDictCache

### Notes:
- LFU stands for Least Frequent Used with meaning of deleting Least Frequent Used association
- In the case of equaled frequency the least recent used key-value association should be deleted
- consider using DictCache class (see main.py file)
- consider using SortedDict class from sortedcontainers package

### Make sure that all tests from test_lfu_dict_cache passed
